# Sales Data Analysis & Automated Excel Business Report

###  Project Overview

This project performs an end-to-end sales data analysis using Python and generates a clean, business-ready Excel report.
The goal is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights that stakeholders can easily understand.
The project covers data validation, aggregation, profitability analysis, visualization, and final reporting.

### Objectives

Clean and validate raw sales data
Analyze sales trends over time
Identify top-performing categories and regions
Evaluate profitability and overall business health
Export results into a structured Excel report with insights

### Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas – data manipulation & analysis
Matplotlib – data visualization
Excel (XLSX) – final business reporting

### Dataset:
Sales dataset containing:
Order Date
Sales
Profit
Category
Region

Note: (Dataset sourced from a public sample sales dataset for learning and analysis purposes.)

### Analysis Workflow
1. Data Validation & Cleaning
Checked for missing values (nulls)
Checked for duplicate records
Ensured correct data types (dates, numeric fields)

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Monthly sales trend analysis
Category-wise sales performance
Region-wise sales distribution

3. Profitability Analysis
Category-wise profit analysis
Overall profit margin calculation

4. Data Visualization

Line chart for monthly sales trends
Bar charts for category and regional performance

5.  Business Insights
Identified top-performing product categories
Highlighted low-profit areas needing attention
Observed regional demand concentration
Analyzed seasonal sales patterns
Evaluated overall business efficiency using profit margin

6. Key Business Insights
Technology is the highest revenue and profit-generating category
Furniture shows relatively low profitability, indicating cost or pricing challenges
West and East regions contribute the largest share of total sales
Monthly sales trends indicate seasonal demand fluctuations
Overall profit margin reflects moderate operational efficiency

7. Final Output

A clean Excel file generated automatically using Python:
Cleaned_Data
Monthly_Sales
Category_Sales
Region_Sales
Category_Profit
Business_Summary
Business_Insights

Note: The Excel report is saved in the same directory as the notebook for simplicity.

### How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook
4. Run cells sequentially
5. The final Excel report will be generated automatically

### Skills Demonstrated
